        <h1>Static Method..!</h1>
        <p>Js provides static methods that belongs to the class instead of an instance of  an that class.These methods are called directly on the class itself. </p>
    </center>
    <hr><h3>Points to remember..!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The static keyword is used to declare a static method.</li>
        <li>The static method can be any name</li>
        <li>A class can contain more than one static method</li>
        <li>If we declare more than one static method with a similar name,the JS always invokes the last one.</li>
        <li>we can use this keyword to call a static method  within another static method.</li>
        <li>we can't use this keyword to call an static method within the non-static method.</li>
        <li>In such case,we can call the static method either using the class name or as the property of the constructor.</li>
    </ul>
