    <h3>What is Promise?</h3>
    <p>Promise is built in constructor of javascript.</p>
    <p>A Promise object represents an operation which has procedure or will eventually produce a value.Promises provide a robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result odf asynchronous request.</p>
    <h3>states of promises</h3>
    <h5>1. Pending</h5>
    <p>The underlying operation has not yet completed or neither rejected</p>

    <h5>2.Fulfilled</h5>
    <p>The operation has finished and promise is fulfilled with a response.(.then()) is used handle fulfilled response.</p>

    <h5>3.Rejected </h5>
    <p>The error occurred during the operation is rejected with a reason.(.catch()) is used to catch the error.</p>

    <h5>4.settled</h5>
    <p>a promise a said to settled,(either resolved or rejected).Once the promise is settled,it becomes immutable.</p>
    <script>
        let x=999;
        const myResponse=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
            if(x>1000){
                resolve("Greater than 1000");
            }else{
                reject("Less than or equal to 1000");
            }
        });
        console.log(myResponse);
        console.log(typeof myResponse);
         //settled promise
        myResponse.then(data=>console.log(data))
        .catch(error=>console.log(error));
